• all of the bugs found by your tests
- Buffer overflow input words - I had words over max length being skipped instead of truncated, which lead to problems with the autograder since they weren't registered as misspelled words.
- I originally made my strtok delimeter include a vast array of random characters instead of just removing from beginning and end of word.
- I wasn't handling non-english characters because I had limited char values to < 127.
- I had a bug where I was truncating number strings like '1976' to nothing and then was still trying to use the string.

• all of the bugs found by fuzzing
- I found crashes when I encountered inserted characters which were interpreted as non-unicode values through AFL.

• how the bugs were fixed
- I limited the bug found in fuzzing by checking my characters to make sure they were in the valid unicode range.  
- I changed my parser to remove punctuation from beginning and end instead of using a large delimiting string.

• how similar bugs can be avoided in the future.
- Dealing with Unicode, as opposed to ASCII, is tricky! Would be nice to limit the input.
- It's good to deal with any input size to a buffer immediately.
